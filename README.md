# Personnel Management System

This is a course project of Computer Program Design of Department of EE., Tsinghua University.

This project is a personnel management system without GUI. It works fine, but it's just a project, which means that cannot be used for real personnel management.

### File list

- ```1.txt```: store personnel information
- ```employee.h```: definitions of classes.
- ```main.cpp```: implementation of classes' member functions and main function.

### Note

This project is created by Visual Studio 2012. Since it only includes source codes, you can try it with any compiler. There is no dependency in this project.
